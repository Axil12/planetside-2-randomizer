planetside2_randomizer is a small application that allows you to randomly draw gear for your loadout.
weapons.json, implants.json nd grendes.json are used to store the available weapons from which you can draw.
Just launch planetside2_randomizer.exe. The rest should be pretty obvious.

IMPORTANT
You can modify config.json to tweak what you want to draw from.
For instance :
Playing NC ? Specify "nc" in the "faction" field. (Possible choices : "vs", "tr", "nc", "nso").
Don't want to randomly draw implants ? Set "false" (without the quotes this time) in the "implants" field. On the opposite, set "true" (no quotes again).
